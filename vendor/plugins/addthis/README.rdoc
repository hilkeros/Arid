= Addthis

Addthis.com provides widgets that make sharing, bookmarking and emailing pages,
and subscribing to feeds easy for your visitors. It supports a broad range of
social network sites and web applications.

This helper makes it easy to add plain or customized Addthis.com widgets to
your Ruby (on Rails) application.

== Installation

If you want to use the Rails 2.1 dependency manager add this environment.rb:

  config.gem 'jaap3-addthis', :lib => 'addthis',
    :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

Then run the following command in your Rails application root:

  rake gems:install

Or use it as a plain plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/jaap3/addthis.git

== Quick Start

This plugin adds 4 new methods to be used in your html views:

  addthis_bookmark_button
  addthis_share_button
  addthis_email_button
  addthis_feed_button(url)

The bookmark_button and share_button are identical except for the default
graphic. The names of email_button and feed_button are self explanitory.

The most basic use is simply providing no arguments, this is possible for the
following methods:

  addthis_bookmark_button
  addthis_share_button
  addthis_email_button

The code generated by Addthis will then try to figure out the url and title by
itself. This is not possible for addthis_feed_button.

You can set a custom url, a required argument for addthis_feed_button:

  addthis_bookmark_button("http://www.example.com/")
  addthis_share_button("http://www.example.com/")
  addthis_email_button("http://www.example.com/")
  addthis_feed_button("http://www.example.com/")

Setting a title is also possible when adding a bookmark, share or email button:

  addthis_bookmark_button("http://www.example.com/", "Example website")
  addthis_share_button("http://www.example.com/", "Example website")
  addthis_email_button("http://www.example.com/", "Example website")

To only set a custom title you can use to options hash:

  addthis_bookmark_button(:page_title => "Example title")
  addthis_share_button(:page_title => "Example title")
  addthis_email_button(:page_title => "Example title")

The options hash can be used to customize the widget to a great extent. Each of
the shown examples can take the options hash as an optional extra argument.

== Usage

If you wish to track analytics for your button, you must create an account at
http://Addthis.com. Joining is free!

After signing up create a new ruby file in config/initializers called
addthis.rb. You can use this file to configure your publisher name (your
Addthis.com username) like so:

  Jaap3::Addthis::CONFIG[:publisher] = "YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"

You can then use this initializer to further override any other settings you
might like.

The default settings are stored in the following constants. You can look in
the source to see what they are.

  Jaap3::Addthis::CONFIG
  Jaap3::Addthis::DEFAULT_OPTIONS
  Jaap3::Addthis::BOOKMARK_BUTTON_DEFAULTS
  Jaap3::Addthis::SHARE_BUTTON_DEFAULTS
  Jaap3::Addthis::FEED_BUTTON_DEFAULTS
  Jaap3::Addthis::EMAIL_BUTTON_DEFAULTS

Besides overriding the default settings using the initializer, each helper
method takes an options hash that can be used to override any setting for
a specific button.

=== Custom services

To change the initial list of services shown when opening the bookmark menu
pass the options hash a list of services you wish to see.

  addthis_bookmark_button(:options => "facebook, email, twitter, more")

For a list of available services see http://addthis.com/help/customize/services.
By modifying the defaults in the initializer you can avoid having to set your
preferred set of services every call.

  Jaap3::Addthis::DEFAULT_OPTIONS[:options] = "facebook, email, twitter, more"

=== Custom images / text

Using a different image or link text is achieved by using the methods with a
block:

  addthis_bookmark_button { "Click here to AddThis!" }

This will output a textlink that behaves exactly like a normal bookmark_button
but withouth the image.

You can also use the block to call the Rails image_tag helper to embed your
own images.

  addthis_bookmark_button { "#{image_tag("bookmark.gif") Bookmark...}"  }

You can permanently change the default image of each button by modifying the
following constants in you initializer:

  Jaap3::Addthis::BOOKMARK_BUTTON_DEFAULTS[:button_html] = "Click here to bookmark this"
  Jaap3::Addthis::SHARE_BUTTON_DEFAULTS[:button_html] = "Click here to share this"
  Jaap3::Addthis::FEED_BUTTON_DEFAULTS[:button_html] = "Click here to subscribe"
  Jaap3::Addthis::EMAIL_BUTTON_DEFAULTS[:button_html] = "Click here to email this"

=== Script options

Addthis.com allows for a few variables to be set to change the appearance of the
widget. These can either be given during a method call:

  addthis_bookmark_button({
    :brand => "Example brand",
    :header_color => "white",
    :header_background => "black",
    :offset_top => -100,
    :offset_left => 125,
    :hover_delay => 200
  })

Or by having your initializer change the defaults stored in:

  Jaap3::Addthis::DEFAULT_OPTIONS

Note that you cannot customize individual buttons on a page. Custom settings
will be applied to all the buttons on a page. This is a limitation of the
Addthis.com widget.

Read more about these options on the the addthis.com website:
* http://addthis.com/help/customize/branding
* http://addthis.com/help/customize/menu-offset
* http://addthis.com/help/customize/hover-delay

=== Secure pages

Calling one of the addthis_button methods with the secure option set to true
like this:

  addthis_bookmark_button(:secure => true)

will output a button usable on https pages.

The default value of the secure option is false, this default can be changed by
setting

  Jaap3::Addthis::DEFAULT_OPTIONS[:secure] = true

in your initializer.

=== Custom language

The Addthis widget language will automatically choose a language based on
the user's browser settings. To override this behaviour you can set a custom
language.

  addthis_bookmark_button(:language => "nl")

or

  Jaap3::Addthis::DEFAULT_OPTIONS[:language] = "nl"

For a list of supported language codes see the bottom of
http://addthis.com/help/localization/translations
